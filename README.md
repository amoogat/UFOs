# UFOs
In this repo, I created a webpage that takes a data set regarding UFO's and makes a HTML webpage using bootstrap for easy and effective formatting and javascript for data transformation and uploading. In order to filter the data, challenge.js checks for the user input so that clicking the "Filter Data" button only displays values that match the given tags.

In order to try out this project, download the entire project as a zip file and open index.html.
